Required DATA Files: /FINAL PROJECT/Final Project Data Files
    .  1- Kaggle Data Archive: original data downloaded
    .  1- Industry Classification_Sector.csv
    .  1- State Geo Location.csv
    .  1- ML_job_postings_finale_ready_v2.csv

Optional data files: /FINAL PROJECT/Final Project Data Files
    .  If the user runs all '1- ...data cleaning PART..'files, the optional data files will be generated. 
    .  1- df_describe.xlsx: The general stats of the CLEANED dataset 


Which file to begin with?

    .  For user who need to review data cleaning process or modify data cleaning, start from: 
        .  '1-ML final project data cleaning PART 1.ipynb'
        .  '1-ML final project data cleaning PART 1.ipynb'
        .  '1-ML final project data cleaning PART 3 NLP.ipynb'
        .  '1-ML final project data cleaning PART 4.ipynb'
        .  '1-ML final project data cleaning PART 5.ipynb'

    .  For user only need to review models, skip all '1-ML final project data cleaning PART...' files.
        .  Data file: /FINAL PROJECT/Final Project Data Files/1- ML_job_postings_finale_ready_v2.csv
        .  Run '2-' series files for Linear Regression Models. Each file can by run independantly. 
        .  Run '3-' series files for SVM Models. Each file can by run independantly. 
        .  Run '4-' series files for Decision Tree Models. Each file can by run independantly. 
        .  Run '5-' series files for Clustering Models. Each file can by run independantly.
